- `git init`: create git repository in current folder.
	- you only do this one per repository.
	- do not nest git repositories.
- `git status`: shows you a status of any commits within the repo; 
		version control; shows who did what.
- `git add <files>`: when written before a filename, it will put you in
		the staging area (index).
- `git commit`: when saving to the master or main branch, 
		you write what changes you did in order for
	        others to follow. The file merges into master or main.

- `git log`: show you your log history
	- `git log --oneline`: one line version of your history.

- `git diff`: will show you the differences
